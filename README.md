# Video-Game-Sales-Analysis
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global video game sales data from 1985 to 2019 with the primary objective to gather meaningful insights to enable data driven decision making for game development, market strategy, and platform investment. Our dataset encompasses critical metrics including global/regional sales figures, genre classifications, release year, platform distributions, and publisher information. Using the information provided in the dataset, we aim to identify market trends, genre popularity, and correlations between game ratings and commercial performance.
This project highlighted the critical importance of thoroughly vetting datasets before designing analytical approaches. Our experience revealed how incomplete understanding of data limitations can fundamentally alter the scope and direction of research. Although we were fortunate that our dataset still yielded meaningful insights, this outcome shouldn't be taken for granted. Such data constraints could have easily rendered the analysis unusable for its original forecasting purpose.
